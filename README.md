Cascade-seeding algorithm for graph dominance competitions (Caltech Winter 2015 CS 144)

## "Pandemaniac" Competition Guidelines

In groups of 2 or 3, create an algorithm that will take as input an undirected graph (in adjacencylist form) and output a list of N seed nodes where your epidemic will start (where N is given).
You will be competing against other teams who are also trying to spread their epidemics on the same graph.
Your team's goal is to take over more of the network (i.e., a larger number of nodes) with your epidemic than your competitors do with theirs.
